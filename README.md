# Interview Scheduler

Welcome to my Interview Scheduler! Mike Law, LHL Student

Interview Scheduler is a simple, yet powerful calendar for booking, editing and canceling interviews.

Within the app, you can create a new appointment based on interviewer specific availablity. Once an appointment has been created, you can delete or edit them at any point. Office hours are between 12pm-5pm, and no new appointments after 4pm.
